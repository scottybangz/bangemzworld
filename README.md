Hello, world. I am scottybangz. I am new to the coding world. I like live music, good food, coffee, and Alabama football.

## Getting started.
I need to learn something new or at least create a `package.json`.


I like code in JavaScript:
```js
function helloWorld() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
  return;
}
```
